    1. Programatically manipulating/viewing the object with textures:
        Current tools (open3d) pose limitations with wrapping a texture
        around an object. While the rough end result is already viewable
        in Photoshop, I am making it programatically accessible. The project
        is under migration from python to javascript (React + three.js).
        I am still learning the basics of three.js
