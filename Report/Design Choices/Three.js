Although there are various graphics libraries, we gravitated towards one that employed the power, flexibility and universality of the internet. 

Thus we chose webGL for rendering and manipulting 3D objects.

Furthermore, since WebGL since WebGL is a very low-level system that only draws points, lines, and triangles, to do anything useful with WebGL generally requires quite a bit of code.

That is why we chose three.js which handles compoents like scenes, lights, shadows, materials, textures and 3D math. Three.js saves a lot of time and prevents us from reinventing the proverbial wheel. (i.e, saves us time from having to write the code ourselves if we were to use WebGL directly.)
